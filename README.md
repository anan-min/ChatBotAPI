README: API Processing Framework
Overview
This project is an API processing framework built using the Quart web framework. It orchestrates multiple services to process incoming requests, transcribe audio, query external APIs, generate speech, analyze sentiment, and return a structured response.

Features
The application consists of several processors, each responsible for a distinct task in the pipeline. These processors integrate with different external services such as Google Cloud, OpenAI, Ollama, Botnoi, and Amazon. The main goal is to provide a seamless flow of request processing, transcription, query response, speech generation, and sentiment analysis.

How It Works
The application processes incoming POST requests as follows:

Request Handling: Validates and initializes a session for the incoming request.
Transcription: Converts audio input into text using transcription services.
Query Processing: Sends the transcribed text to a query service and receives a response.
Speech Processing: Generates a speech response for the query and analyzes sentiment.
Response Generation: Returns a structured response to the client.
Dependencies
Quart: ASGI framework for handling requests and responses asynchronously.
External Services: Includes integrations with:
Google Cloud: For speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing.
OpenAI: For query processing and natural language understanding.
Ollama: For advanced AI-driven responses.
Botnoi: For chatbot responses and additional AI features.
Amazon: For sentiment analysis and cloud-based processing.


Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

bash

API Endpoint
/ (POST)
Handles incoming requests and processes them through the pipeline.

Request Format
json
Copy code
{
  "audio_file": "base64_encoded_audio_data",
  "metadata": {
    "user_id": "string",
    "language": "string",
    "other_parameters": "any"
  }
}
Response Format
json
Copy code
{
  "transcribed_text": "string",
  "query_response": "string",
  "sentiment_analysis": {
    "emotion": "string",
    "score": "number"
  },
  "speech_file": "base64_encoded_audio_response"
}
Components
1. Processors
TranscribeProcessor: Converts audio to text using Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API.
QueryProcessor: Sends transcribed text to OpenAI, Ollama, or Botnoi for query processing.
SpeechProcessor: Generates speech output using Google Cloud or Amazon Polly.
SentimentProcessor: Analyzes sentiment and emotion using Amazon Comprehend or similar services.
ResponseProcessor: Formats the final output to send back to the client.
RequestProcessor: Validates and initializes session data.
2. Utilities
files_handler: Handles temporary file operations.
SessionManager: Manages session data throughout the pipeline.
timing: Utility for measuring processing time of each stage.
Example Workflow
Request Processing:
The audio file and metadata are extracted and validated. A SessionManager instance is initialized to manage session-specific data.

Transcription:
The TranscribeProcessor uses Google Cloud to transcribe the audio input into text.

Query Processing:
The QueryProcessor sends the transcribed text to OpenAI, Ollama, or Botnoi for further interpretation.

Speech and Sentiment Analysis:
The SpeechProcessor generates a speech response, while the SentimentProcessor analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed text.

Response Generation:
The ResponseProcessor compiles the results and returns a structured response to the client.

Example Response
json
Copy code
{
  "transcribed_text": "Hello, how can I help you?",
  "query_response": "I can assist with any questions you have.",
  "sentiment_analysis": {
    "emotion": "positive",
    "score": 0.95
  },
  "speech_file": "base64_audio_data_here"
}
